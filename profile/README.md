# Pulse UI 

Pulse is a professional design system for web development. It supports pure HTML and CSS components. 

## Get Started 

Pulse UI will support: 
- `HTML` `CSS` 
- `Vue` 

> Pulse UI is still under development. A better CDN option will be available for Pulse UI in the future. 

### GitHub 

Fork the repository and extract the `pulse.css` file for personal use. 

### CDN 

Pulse UI is available through a [JSDelivr CDN](https://jsdelivr.com) that connects to the github pages deployment. 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pulseui/pulseui.github.io/pulse.css"/>
```

It is better to place the CDN link **after** your website's stylesheets. 

## Appearance 

Pulse UI components are inspired by [Material](https://material.io) but are much more lightweight and friendly to use. Pulse uses fewer nested elements to improve developer experience and deliver simple components.
